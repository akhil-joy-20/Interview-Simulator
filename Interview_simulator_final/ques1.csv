1,AI,1What do you understand by Artificial Intelligence?,Artificial intelligence is computer science technology that emphasizes creating intelligent machine that can mimic human behavior Here Intelligent machines can be defined as the machine that can behave like a human think like a human and also capable of decision making It is made up of two words Artificial and Intelligence which means the man-made thinking ability With artificial intelligence we do not need to pre-program the machine to perform a task instead we can create a machine with the programmed algorithms and it can work on its own
2,AI,2What are the different domains/Subsets of AI?,Machine Learning Deep Learning Natural Language processing Expert System Robotics Machine Vision Speech Recognition
3,AI,3Explain the term "Q-Learning"?,Q-learning is a popular algorithm used in reinforcement learning It is based on the Bellman equation. In this algorithm the agent tries to learn the policies that can provide the best actions to perform for maximining the rewards under particular circumstances. The agent learns these optimal policies from past experiences. In Q-learning the Q is used to represent the quality of the actions at each state and the goal of the agent is to maximize the value of Q.

7,ML,7Explain SVM Algorithm?,SVM is a machine learning algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in a dataset by considering support vectors and maximizing the margin between them.
8,ML,8What is Bias in Machine Learning?,Bias in machine learning refers to the systematic errors that a model makes when predicting outcomes due to its tendency to learn and favor certain patterns in the training data This can lead to inaccurate or unfair predictions especially when the model is used on new unseen data Bias can arise from various sources such as an imbalanced dataset inappropriate feature selection or a biased model architecture It is important to identify and address bias in machine learning models to ensure fair and accurate predictions.
9,ML,9What is regression?,Regression is a type of supervised machine learning technique used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables also known as predictors or features The goal of regression is to find the relationship between the input variables and the output variable and use this relationship to make predictions on new data Regression can be used for various applications such as predicting stock prices house prices or customer demand based on historical data There are different types of regression techniques such as linear regression polynomial regression logistic regression and ridge regression among others.
10,ML,10what is classification?,Classification is a type of supervised machine learning technique used to predict the class or category of a new data point based on its input features The goal of classification is to learn a model from labeled training data that can predict the class of new unseen data For example a classification model can be used to predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content or to classify images of animals based on their features There are different types of classification algorithms such as decision trees logistic regression support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks.
11,html,11What is HTML?,HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language of the internet It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying pages on the Internet HTML documents are made up of the elements and the tags that format it for proper display on pages.
12,html,12What are HTML tags?,We use HTML tags for placing the elements in the proper and appropriate format Tags use the symbols < and > to set them apart from the HTML content The HTML tags need not be closed always For example in the case of images the closing tags are not required as <img> tag.
13,html,13Define the list types in HTML?,Ordered list The ordered list uses <ol> tag and displays elements in a numbered format Unordered list The unordered list uses <ul> tag and displays elements in a bulleted format.Definition list The definition list uses <dl> <dt> <dd> tags and displays elements in definition form like in a dictionary.
14,html,14Define an image map?,An image map in HTML helps in linking with the different kinds of web pages using a single image It can be used for defining shapes in the images that are made part of the image mapping process.
15,html,15What is white space in HTML?,An empty sequence of space characters is called the white space in HTML This white space is considered as a single space character in the HTML White space helps the browser to merge multiple spaces into one single space and so taking care of indentation becomes easier White space helps in better organizing the content and tags making them readable and easy to understand.
16,java,16What is a ClassLoader?,A classloader in Java is a subsystem of Java Virtual Machine dedicated to loading class files when a program is executed ClassLoader is the first to load the executable file Java has Bootstrap Extension and Application classloaders
17,java,17What are the Memory Allocations available in Java?,Class Memory Heap Memory Stack Memory Program Counter Memory Native Method Stack Memory.
18,java,18What is an Association?,An Association can be defined as a relationship that has no ownership over another For example a person can be associated with multiple banks and a bank can be related to various people but no one can own the other.
19,java,19What do you mean by aggregation?,The term aggregation refers to the relationship between two classes best described as a whole part and has a relationship This kind is the most specialized version of an association relationship It contains the reference to another class and is said to have ownership of that class.
20,java,20What is Object Cloning?,An ability to recreate an object entirely similar to an existing object is known as Object Cloning in Java Java provides a clone() method to clone a current object offering the same functionality as the original object.
21,python,21What is Scope in Python?,A local scope refers to the local objects available in the current function A global scope refers to the objects available throughout the code execution since their inception A module level scope refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program An outermost scope refers to all the built in names callable in the program The objects in this scope are searched last to find the name referenced.
22,python,22What is the use of self in Python?,Self is used to represent the instance of the class With this keyword you can access the attributes and methods of the class in python It binds the attributes with the given arguments self is used in different places and often thought to be a keyword But unlike in C++ self is not a keyword in Python.
23,python,23What is break?,The break statement terminates the loop immediately and the control flows to the statement after the body of the loop.
24,python,24What is continue?,The continue statement terminates the current iteration of the statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows to the next iteration of the loop.
